# Busuu backend engineer test
#


This test allows you to demonstrate knowledge directly relevant to the work we do at busuu: use of a PHP framework, creation of a REST API, unit testing, and use of git.

This repository uses the SLIM framework (http://www.slimframework.com/). It's a very simple, lightweight PHP framework.
Note that the classes in the EntityRepository are incomplete, this is on purpose: we are not interested in the database storage, and we don't need to be able to execute the code. You don't need to complete the code in those classes.
The point of this exercise is too see how you would structure the logic of your code, not to execute it.


The file /src/index.php already contains a REST endpoint to allow users to create exercises. An exercise contains text and is associated with a user.

**Please answer the following question (in writing), and complete the code task.**

##### Question:
Read the existing code for the endpoint to create an exercise. Do you see anything that is missing or could be improved?

##### Code task:
In the file /src/index.php, create a new endpoint to allow a user to vote for another user's exercise. A vote is a "thumb up" or a "thumb down".
You are free to create new classes and unit/functional tests.
Use of git to version your code is a plus.



Thanks for taking the time to complete this test and don't hesitate to email us if you have any question!
