We want to create a REST API to allow users to create exercises, and to vote for other users' exercises.
An exercise is simply a text associated with a user.
A vote is a thumb up or thumb down attributed to an exercise by a user.

The file Controller/controller.php already contains a REST endpoint to create an exercise.
Your task is to create a second endpoint in this file that allows users to vote for an exercise.
